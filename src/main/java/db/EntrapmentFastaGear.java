/**
 * Build a peptide-level FASTA + FDRBench-style pairing manifest from a protein FASTA.
 *
 * <p>This is a Java port of the lab's {@code build_entrapment_peptide_fasta.py}. For each
 * tryptic peptide it can optionally also emit an entrapment ({@code p_target}) peptide, a
 * {@code decoy}, and a {@code p_decoy}. The entrapment ({@code p_target}) sequence is a
 * deterministic shuffle of the target (C-terminus preserved). The decoys ({@code decoy} /
 * {@code p_decoy}) are generated the same way Osprey's {@code DecoyGenerator} does: reverse the
 * peptide (C-terminus preserved), and cycle the internal residues to avoid colliding with a real
 * target. A quartet is dropped when its entrapment shuffle collides with a real target or when a
 * requested reverse decoy cannot be made unique (FDRBench collision-drop policy).</p>
 *
 * <p>The output FASTA has one entry per peptide whose accession is the source protein accession
 * (optionally with a per-source {@code _pepNNNNN} counter so library predictors that dedupe by
 * accession - e.g. Carafe - accept every entry). Carafe is then run over this FASTA in
 * {@code NoCut} mode so AlphaPepDeep predicts spectra/RT for every target and decoy sequence,
 * giving Osprey a library with both target and decoy entries.</p>
 *
 * <p>Digestion reuses {@link DBGear#digest_protein(Enzyme, String)} with the global
 * {@link CParameter} digest options (enzyme, missed cleavages, length, clip N-term M) so the
 * peptide set matches the GUI's configured digestion. The m/z filter and shuffle constants are
 * ported from the Python script.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Shuffle note:</b> the per-peptide RNG seed is derived as SHA-1({@code master_seed:seq})
 * exactly as in the Python script, but the shuffle itself uses {@link java.util.Random}'s
 * Fisher-Yates rather than CPython's Mersenne-Twister {@code random.shuffle}. The shuffled
 * sequences therefore differ from the Python tool's, but they are deterministic and
 * self-consistent: the manifest always matches the FASTA, which is all Osprey requires.</p>
