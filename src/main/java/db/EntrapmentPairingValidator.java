/**
 * Integrity checks on the entrapment pairing, so a broken pairing is refused at the source rather
 * than worked around downstream.
 *
 * <p>A paired FDP estimator (FDRBench, and Osprey's entrapment diagnostics) assumes every
 * entrapment peptide has a target twin. When that assumption fails the estimator either crashes or
 * silently mis-scales, and the failure surfaces hours later in a search rather than seconds after
 * library generation. Osprey grew a whole reconciliation class to absorb exactly this; these
 * checks exist so it does not have to.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two distinct failure surfaces and they need separate checks:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Manifest integrity</b> ({@link #validateQuartets}) - what the generator emitted. Cheap,
 *       runs at write time, catches generator bugs.</li>
 *   <li><b>Library against manifest</b> ({@link #validateLibraryAgainstManifest}) - what the
 *       predictor produced from it. This is the one that matters most, because the library is
 *       allowed to contain peptide FORMS the manifest never had, and a form that lands on only one
 *       side of a pair is precisely the defect that is invisible to a manifest-only check.</li>
 * </ol>
